    <p>Hello, welcome to my website! As you are here, you are probably wondering what this is.
      I have been learning to code with my uncle and here is what I've learnt. This is a fun project
      I have been working on as part of a competition between my cousin, my brother and me.
      If I win I will get Â£25! Wish me luck.</p>
